# GrimReaperAI

**AI-driven game using A* pathfinding and reinforcement learning**

## About

GrimReaperAI is a game built in **Godot** that explores artificial intelligence techniques for enemy behavior and decision making. The project combines **A* pathfinding** for efficient navigation with a **Q-learning–based reinforcement learning system** that allows the enemy to adapt its movement strategy over time.

The goal of this project was to understand how traditional pathfinding algorithms can be combined with learning-based approaches to create more dynamic and responsive game AI.

## Key Features

* A* pathfinding for real-time navigation in grid-based environments
* Q-learning system for adaptive enemy behavior and decision making
* Modular AI architecture for experimenting with different reward functions and strategies
* Clean separation between game logic and AI components

## Requirements

* Godot Engine (tested with Godot 4.x)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shreevatsan-S/GrimReaperAI.git
   ```

2. Open the project in **Godot Engine**

3. Set `Menu.tscn` as the main scene (if not already set)

4. Press **F5** or click **Play** to run the project

## Learning Outcomes

* Implemented **A*** for shortest-path navigation
* Designed and tuned a **Q-learning reward system** for AI behavior
* Gained experience structuring AI systems within a real-time game loop
